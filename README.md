# SQL-project
Identify optimal locations for opening a new Drug Store outlet in the United States. By analyzing demographic data, foot traffic patterns, and existing hospital information, we aim to highlight areas with high potential for drug store success. This data will then inform our recommendations for a suitable client seeking promising store locations.
# Key Findings:
• Brand Focus: There are 59 brands that match the NAICS code 446110, which represents pharmacies and drug stores. After a thorough analysis, we identified one standout brand: Safeway Pharmacy.

• Optimum Location: After detailed analysis, we found that King County in Washington is the optimum location to start the business. It has a high concentration of the adult population (25% aged 55-84) and excellent footfall in the nearby hospitals, making it a strong candidate for a successful store launch.

• Outlets Analysis: On average, drug store brands in the U.S. have 466.06 outlets. Major outliers in the data are CVS (9,906 outlets), Walgreens (8,605 outlets), and RiteAid (3,292 outlets). These outliers are dominant, while smaller, local brands such as Clark's Rx operate with as few as 1 outlet. After removing such outliers, the average number of outlets for the remaining brands provides a more realistic picture of expansion opportunities.

• Geographic Dominance: Many brands tend to have a stronghold in a specific state. This suggests a strategic opportunity for expansion in states where those particular brands have little or no presence.

• Wholesaler Concentration: The highest number of drug wholesalers are in Oklahoma, which could be a factor when considering supply chain logistics for new outlets.

• Data Gaps: It is important to note that we do not have population data for certain states, including Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, and Connecticut, as well as specific counties like Bristol Bay Borough, Denali Borough, and Kenai Peninsula Borough. This limits our analysis in these areas, and they may offer additional opportunities that we were unable to evaluate.

This analysis positions Safeway Pharmacy as a strong candidate for expansion in underrepresented areas, particularly in King County, Washington, where demographic trends and
hospital foot traffic suggest high success potential. Detailed analysis of these key findings are discussed in this report.
# Introduction
Background:
Healthcare has always been a vital aspect of any country’s well-being, and providing quality healthcare facilities is essential. These facilities should include easily accessible pharmacies and drug stores, ensuring that patients can conveniently obtain necessary medications when visiting hospitals. Motivated by this gap in healthcare access, we used data-driven analysis to identify ideal locations for drug stores near hospitals. Our goal is to enhance healthcare accessibility while offering strategic business solutions. By focusing on well-performing drug stores with fewer than average locations, we identified potential areas for expansion that can benefit both the business and the community.

Objectives: 
The purpose of this report is to determine the best location for opening a new store. Our team has focused on analyzing key data to answer the following questions:
1. Which brand should we focus on?
2. Which county and state will provide the optimal location to maximize profit while
minimizing risk?
3. Which street should the store be opened on?

# Conclusion and Recommendations Actionable Recommendations:
• Target Brand Expansion: Focus on partnering with brands like Safeway Pharmacy, which are mid-sized and looking to expand. These brands show strong performance but are not yet oversaturated in the market.

• Prioritize King County, Washington: Based on the analysis, King County has a high proportion of the adult population and significant hospital footfall, making it an optimal location for a new store.

• Expand Demographic Analysis: As future steps, consider collecting or purchasing more comprehensive demographic data for other counties and states to ensure no viable location is overlooked due to data gaps.

• Monitor Competition: Although RiteAid and Walgreens dominate in many locations, focus on regions where these brands have a weaker presence to minimize competition while capitalizing on unmet demand.
